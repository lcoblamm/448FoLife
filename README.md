Projects for EECS 448

Here’s the instructions for creating your own local repository!
1. Navigate to lynnel/448FoLife.
2. On the right hand side, towards the bottom, you can click clone in desktop. This will download a gui for git. You are welcome to use git via command line too, but I don’t have instructions for how to do that here.
3. Install and open the github application.
4. Navigate to File->New Repository.
5. Choose clone.
6. Select 448FoLife and choose where you want to save the repository on your computer.
7. Now, just edit the files as you like on your computer. You’ll need to commit and sync (or push) your changes for the rest of us to have access and sync (or pull) to get changes others have made.

Some basic notes on git:
Commit saves your changes locally. It means your changes are in your version of the repository, but no one else can see them yet. Commit early and commit often!

Push sends all changes that you’ve made locally to the main repository so that all of us can see it and access it.

Pull gets the changes other people have made while you’re away and adds them to your local repository.

The github gui has a sync button that combines push & pull.

If you & someone else both make changes to a file, you will need to merge those changes. Not sure yet how that will work with the gui and such, so we’ll have to see!
